# Beara Seaview Bed & Breakfast

## About Project
The core purpose of this project is to create a website that promotes the featurea and unique offerings of the Beara Searview Bed and Breakfast. The building is currently underconstruction so I've used stock images until real images of the completed renovations are available. 

## UX

Yes  | I need to read general description of B&B, 	so that I can compare to others in the area

Yes  | I want access to B&B social media profiles, 	so that I can see interactions from visitors.

### Design
I would have liked to use the Materialize framework as it's really impressive but my skill level is not yet there. It's something I'm looking forward to working towards.

### Color Scheme

* material.io/

I used the tool [material.io](https://material.io/resources/color/#!/?view.left=1&view.right=1&primary.color=D1C4E9&secondary.color=BBDEFB&secondary.text.color=000000&primary.text.color=0a0a0a) to create a primary and secondary color palette.

### Icons

I used [Font Awesome](x) for the website's social media icons. Font Awesome has an incredible collection and make it straight forward to integrate their icons into a project which can then be customised to fit the design and colour scheme. I used these three icons:

### Typography

I used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/share?selection.family=Oxygen|Ubuntu). Google Fonts website is great to choosing fonts. If you pick one, it will recommend others that pair well with your first font. I've choose Oxygeny and Ubuntu because they are clean and easy to read.

### Wireframes

I used Balsamiq to create wireframes. Wireframing helped me get from the idea stage to coding. This in between step helped me breakdown the website into features. Below are my wireframes.
