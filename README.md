### Design
I would have liked to use the Materialize framework as it's really impressive but my skill level is not yet there. It's something I'm looking forward to working towards.

### Color Scheme

* material.io/

I used the tool [material.io](https://material.io/resources/color/#!/?view.left=1&view.right=1&primary.color=D1C4E9&secondary.color=BBDEFB&secondary.text.color=000000&primary.text.color=0a0a0a) to create a primary and secondary color palette.

### Typography



### Wireframes

I used Balsamiq to create wireframes. Below are my wireframes.
